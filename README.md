Hello, 

Welcome to my Fantasy Football game, Hoosier Hills Fantasy Football! The python file of the game is in the HHFF folder titled “fantasyfootball.py”

About the game:
During my independent study of computer science my junior year of high school, I was given a semester to create a capstone project in the form of a game.
When I received the assignment, I had recently just drafted my first NFL Fantasy Football game, and I thought a good project idea would be to recreate
the game with athletes from my high school’s conference (Hoosier Hills). Using the keyboard as a user you will input what logo and players you would like 
for your fantasy team, and based on real stats from each of the players 9 game roster your team will compete against two other randomized teams. I utilised
text files, Pygame, many conditional statements, functions, and any more features in Python to create this game.
